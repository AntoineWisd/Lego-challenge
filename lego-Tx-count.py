        # Retrieve the number of transactions for the address using a blockchain API
        tx_count = get_tx_count(address)
        # Check if the number of transactions for the address is greater than the minimum limit configured

# This code creates a WalletTxCountLego class which takes in a configuration parameter for the minimum number of transactions for an address to be 
# considered valid (default is 3 transactions). The check_address method takes in an Ethereum address and uses a fictional function get_tx_count to 
# retrieve the number of transactions for that address using a blockchain API. It then checks if the number of transactions for the address is greater
# than the minimum limit configured and returns True if it is, False otherwise.

# get_tx_count function would need to be replaced with a function that uses a real API to retrieve the number of transactions for an address.
