    def __init__(self, min_age_days=90):
        self.min_age_days = min_age_days

    def check_address(self, address):
        # Retrieve the date of the address's first transaction using a blockchain API
        first_tx_date = get_first_tx_date(address)
        # Calculate the number of days between the current date and the first transaction date
        age_days = (datetime.datetime.now() - first_tx_date).days
        # Check if the address age is greater than the minimum limit set
        if age_days >= self.min_age_days:

        else:
            return False

# This code creates a WalletAgeLego class that takes a minimum number of days for an address to be considered valid as a configuration parameter 
# (default 90 days). The check_address method takes an Ethereum address as input and uses a fictional function get_first_tx_date to retrieve the 
# date of the address's first transaction using a blockchain API. It then calculates the number of days between the current date and the first 
# transaction date using Python's datetime module. Finally, it checks if the address age in days is greater than the minimum limit set and returns 
# True if it is, False otherwise.

# get_first_tx_date function would need to be replaced with a function that uses a real API to retrieve the first transaction date of an address.
