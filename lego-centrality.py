#This code creates a WalletCentralityLego class that takes a centrality measure to use (default 'betweenness') as a configuration parameter to evaluate 
# the centrality of an Ethereum address in the transaction network. The check_address method takes an Ethereum address as input and uses a hypothetical 
# get_transactions function to retrieve the transactions of that address using a blockchain API. It then uses these transactions to build a transaction 
# graph using a hypothetical build_tx_graph function. It then calculates the centrality of the address in the graph using the specified centrality measure, 
# and checks if the address centrality is higher than the median centrality of the other nodes in the graph (calculated by a hypothetical 
# calculate_median_centrality function). If the address centrality is higher than the median, it returns False, otherwise True.

# functions get_transactions, build_tx_graph, and calculate_median_centrality would need to be replaced by functions that use a real API to retrieve the 
# transactions and build the transaction graph, as well as to calculate the median centrality in this graph. 
# We use the NetworkX library to build the graph and calculate the centrality, but there are other libraries and methods to do this. So it might be 
# necessary to choose another method that is suitable for the real data.
