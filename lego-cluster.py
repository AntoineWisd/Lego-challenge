# This code creates a WalletClusterLego class which takes the number of clusters to use for cluster analysis as a configuration parameter (default is 5). 
# The check_address method takes an Ethereum address as input and uses a fictional get_transactions function to retrieve the transactions of that address 
# using a blockchain API. It then uses these transactions to retrieve addresses related to this address using a fictional get_related_addresses function. 
# It then retrieves the transactions of all related addresses using the get_transactions function and converts these transactions into a matrix for using 
# cluster analysis techniques using the create_txs_matrix function. It then uses a clustering algorithm (here, KMeans) to group related addresses using the 
# transactions matrix. It then retrieves the cluster of the given address using the predict method of KMeans and retrieves addresses in the same cluster by 
# looping through the clustering labels produced by KMeans. Finally, it checks if the given address is in the list of addresses in the same cluster and 
# returns True if it is, otherwise False.

# get_transactions, get_related_addresses, and create_txs_matrix functions would need to be replaced by functions that use a real API to retrieve 
# transactions and create the transactions matrix. 
# We use the scikit-learn library for cluster analysis, but there are other libraries and methods available for cluster analysis.
