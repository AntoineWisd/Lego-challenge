# This code creates a WalletInteractionsLego class that takes as configuration parameters a minimum number of addresses that have interacted for an 
# address to be considered valid (default 10 addresses) and the interaction rules (default: out transactions). The check_address method takes an Ethereum 
# address as input and uses a fictional get_interacting_addresses function to retrieve the addresses that have interacted with this address using a blockchain
# API. It then checks if the number of addresses that have interacted with the address is greater than the minimum limit and returns True if that is the case,
# False otherwise.

# The get_interacting_addresses function would have to be replaced with a function that uses a real API to retrieve the addresses that have interacted with 
# a given address.
