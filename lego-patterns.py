# This code creates a WalletTxPatternLego class that takes a contamination rate as a configuration parameter to indicate the proportion of elements to 
# consider as suspicious (default 0.1) and uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect suspicious patterns in Ethereum address transactions. 
# The check_address method takes an Ethereum address as input and uses a fictional get_transactions function to retrieve the transactions of that address 
# using a blockchain API. It then converts these transactions into a DataFrame to use pattern recognition algorithms, trains an anomaly detection model 
# on the transaction data, uses the model to detect suspicious patterns in the address's transactions, and checks if there are suspicious patterns in the 
# address's transactions. If there are, it returns False, otherwise True.

# get_transactions function would need to be replaced with a function that uses a real API to retrieve the transactions of a given address.
