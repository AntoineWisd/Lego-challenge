# This code creates a SybilDetectionPipeline class that uses the scikit-learn's Pipeline class to combine multiple legos into a pipeline. 
# It also uses the ColumnTransformer class to select the data columns to use for each lego. It defines a pipeline with the following legos:

# 1/ AddressAgeLego with a min_age configuration parameter that checks the address's age.
# 2/ TransactionsNumberLego with a min_txs configuration parameter that checks the number of transactions made by the address.
# 3/ RelatedAddressesLego with min_addresses and rule configuration parameters that check the number of related addresses to the address.
# 4/ TransactionsPatternsLego that uses pattern recognition algorithms to detect suspicious patterns in the address's transactions.
# 5/ AddressCentralityLego that uses centrality methods to evaluate the address's centrality in the transaction network.
# 6/ WalletClusterLego that uses clustering analysis techniques to identify groups of addresses that appear to be related to each other.

# It also uses a classifier to classify addresses as Sybil or not. The classifier to use depends on the data and results obtained from the different legos. 
# Classifiers like RandomForestClassifier, SVM, XGBoost, ... can be used. It is also possible to combine results from multiple classifiers to get 
# better performance.

# Of course, it is more efficient to add more legos to improve the Sybil address detection performance. Functions get_transactions, get_related_addresses, 
# and create_txs_matrix would need to be replaced with functions that use a real API to retrieve transactions and create the transactions matrix. 
# As it is only a preliminary work, it would be necessary to validate and test this pipeline with real data to evaluate its actual performance.
